# DSCI 532 - GROUP 109: Titanic Dashboard Project

This app consists of a dashboard containing visualizations related to the survival of passengers on the Titanic ship based on their cabin location. Users can select specific decks on the ship via radio buttons and see whether the passengers in each cabin survived or died during the disaster.  

For each deck, cabins are also partitioned into passenger classes, which allows users to see whether this variable had an effect on the chance of survival. Additionally, users can hover over individual data points to view personal information related to that passenger, such as their name, age and gender. 

In additional to this visualization, two bar graphs allow users to see the aggregate death rates as a function of passenger class and deck level. A sketch of the dashboard is included below.
