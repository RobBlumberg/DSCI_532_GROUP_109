Based on peer feedback, The Titanic ship schematic with passenger cabin locations is a clean, easy to understand, and easy to use visualization which helps users analyze and explore the proposed research question succinctly captured by the jumbotron title. The use of the dropdown as the single interactive feature in combination with the two static horizontal bar charts for survival rates by class and deck respectively is effective at showing how passenger fates vary by these two attributes which is otherwise difficult to visualize in two dimensions on a single plot since all three classes of passenger cabins (1-3) are found on all seven decks (A-G).

In its current form, the dashboard does not consider passenger fates by other attributes such as gender, age, marital status, or port of origin which are interesting but separate research questions requiring additional visualizations. To enhance the visualization of the current research question, we could also consider using colour to encode the three classes in the deck levels legend where the area of each colour is proportional to the share of its corresponding cabins class on each deck level. A more ambitious improvement would be to create a 3D interactive visualization of the ship which would allow the user to rotate the ship about the x, y and z axes to visualize passenger fate by specific cabin class, deck and natutical location (i.e. bow-stern, port-starboard) at a single glance with tooltips providing additional passenger attributes.

Process wise, I believe we have communicated effectively using Github Issues while our strict adherence to the git push and pull request protocol in combination with appropriate use of Slack notifications has allowed us to work remotely with high efficiency and without merge conflicts.
